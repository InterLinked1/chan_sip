    summary: 'Test T.38 ast_channel_queryoption() requests on local_channels.'
    description: |
        "This test starts two asterisk instances and sends a fax between them
         running local channels on both the send and receive side.  If the
         ast_channel_queryoption() call works correctly, then the fax should be
         completed in T.38 mode.  If the queryoption call fails, SendFax and
         ReceiveFax will attempt to do an audio fax.  The audio fax will fail,
         because the gsm codec is being used for the audio on the call."
