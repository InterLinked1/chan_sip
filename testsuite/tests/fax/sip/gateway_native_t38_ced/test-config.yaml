    summary: 'Test the fax gateway.'
    description: |
        This test verifies that the gateway properly disabled itself when the
        two channels involved demonstrated that they can natively do t38. The
        receiving side will generate a CED tone, the test should verify that
        the gateway handles this properly.

        The call flow looks like this:
         |send        |
         |t38      t38|
         |----------->|
         |     gateway|
         |t38      t38|
         |<-----------|
        \|receive     |/
