    summary: 'Test the fax gateway.'
    description: |
        This test verifies proper gateway functionality when a pass through
        t38 negotiation request fails. The sending side will reject the passed
        through negotiation request. The gateway should detect this respond to
        the receiving side as if no failure had occured and then gateway the
        fax.

        The call flow looks like this:
         |send        |
         |g711     t38|
         |----------->|
         |     gateway|
         |t38      t38|
         |<-----------|
        \|receive     |/
