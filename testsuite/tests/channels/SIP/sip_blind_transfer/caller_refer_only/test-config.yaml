    summary:     'Test SIP Blind Transfer (caller transfers)'
    description: |
        This test verifies a SIP Blind transfer in which
        Phone A calls Phone B through Asterisk.  Phone A then
        requests a transfer for Phone B to Phone C.  At the end
        of the test, Phone A is hung up, while Phone B and C
        are bridged together.  No re-INVITE is sent to put Phone B
        on hold before Phone B is transferred.
