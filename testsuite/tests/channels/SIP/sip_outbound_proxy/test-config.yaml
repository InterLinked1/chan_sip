    summary:     'Test outbound proxy use on outbound INVITE dialog'
    description: |
        "Send an INVITE to an outbound proxy, who challenges for authentication.
        The authentication challenge will have a Contact header set to a different
        address. Asterisk should send the ACK as well as the followup INVITE to
        the outbound proxy. The outbound proxy will then respond to the followup
        INVITE with a 200 OK. The 200 OK will have a Contact header set to a a
        different address from the outbound proxy. Asterisk should then send the
        ACK to the 200 OK to this Contact."
