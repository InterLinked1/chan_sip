    summary: 'Test SIP Hold with ICE'
    description: |
        This tests a PJSIP assertion crash in 11.7 detailed somewhat in
        https://issues.asterisk.org/jira/browse/ASTERISK-23213 - A call
        is started with ICE enabled. A call is started from A to B with
        some ICE candidates listed that are known to cause a crash in
        11.7. The call is then put on hold hold (which is the trigger
        for the crash) and taken off hold. If both the hold and unhold
        events are received and Asterisk doesn't crash, the test is
        considered successful. Note that the direction of media is not
        considered in this test.
