    summary: 'Test channel leak as described in ASTERISK-20784'
    description: |
        'This tests a scenario where Alice calls Bob through Asterisk.
        Alice hangs up immediately.  But Bob attempts a re-INVITE at
        the same time.  At this point Bob stops to respond.
        If the bug is not fixed, this will leak a sip dialog object.'
