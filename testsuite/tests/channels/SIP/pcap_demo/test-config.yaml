testinfo:
    # This test is skipped as - on some CentOS 6 build agents - the yappcap
    # library will throw an exception indicating that it can't allocate memory.
    # Example:
    #  File "yappcap.pyx", line 490, in yappcap.PcapLive.activate (yappcap.c:4333)
    #   yappcap.PcapError: can't create rx ring on packet socket: Cannot allocate memory
    #
    # This is a random error and doesn't really preclude the usage of using yappcap
    # or the pcap generation utilities in the Test Suite when you need it, but it
    # does make this test unlikely to consistently pass, which is bad for continuous
    # integration.
    skip: True
