Users can now inject custom SIP parameters into arbitrary
SIP headers through use of the SIPAddParameter application.
A SIP_PARAMETER function also allows for parameters to be extracted
from SIP headers.

Additionally, the placement of custom SIP parameters added
to headers can be moved from after the ;tag= tag to
before it to comply with the requirements of some SS7
carriers.
