Users can now inject custom SIP tags into arbitrary
SIP headers through use of the SIPAddTag application.
A SIP_TAG function also allows for tags to be extracted
from SIP headers.

Additionally, the placement of custom SIP tags added
to headers can be moved from after the ;tag= tag to
before it to comply with the requirements of some SS7
carriers.
